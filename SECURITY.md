## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Time Management Matrix, please help us address it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@your-domain.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers privately through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24-48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
3. **Regular Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
5. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on public disclosure timing

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
- **Strong Secrets**: Use strong, unique secrets for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- **Database Security**: Use strong database passwords and enable SSL
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production

### For Developers

- **Authentication**: Follow OAuth 2.0 and security best practices
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens where needed
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints

## 🛠️ Security Features

### Current Implementation

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication with Better Auth
- **Database**: Type-safe database operations with Prisma
- **Environment**: Secure environment variable handling
- **Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent common vulnerabilities

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Enhanced session management
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Input sanitization middleware
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations

## 🔍 Security Scanning

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **ESLint**: Code quality and security linting
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Prisma**: Secure database operations

## 📋 Security Checklist for Deployments

### Development

- [ ] Use `.env.local` for local development
- [ ] Never commit sensitive data
- [ ] Use strong development secrets
- [ ] Test with realistic data volumes

### Production

- [ ] Use environment-specific secrets
- [ ] Enable database SSL
- [ ] Use HTTPS only
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

## 🚀 Deployment Security

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are properly secured in production:

```env
# Use strong, unique values
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="use-a-strong-32-character-secret"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db?sslmode=require"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://your-secure-domain.com"
```

### Database Security

- Use SSL connections (`?sslmode=require`)
- Implement database user permissions
- Regular backups with encryption
- Monitor for unusual activity

### Application Security

- Implement Content Security Policy
- Use secure HTTP headers
- Enable rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security audits

## 📞 Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Email**: [security@your-domain.com]
- **Maintainer**: [Your GitHub username]
- **General Issues**: Use GitHub Issues (for non-security matters)
